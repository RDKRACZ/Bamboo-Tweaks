# Eco

You're a survivor of a great catastrophe in your planet. A massive shield protects you from the withering cold weather of the outside world, but is rapdily losing its strength.

Within 31 days, it will decay to an unsustainable level, allowing the outside world to creep in and destroy your civilization.

Save the world. Save the shield. Save the ecosystem.

## Details

Outside, there is a wasteland version of each biome.
